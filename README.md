Coding practice when read HeadFirstOOAD book

This repo contains three projects. All of them were programming practice when I read HeadFirstOOAD book in December, 2015.
HeadFirstOOAD is a fantastic book, strongly recommend to everyone. 

The [Head First OO Analysis and Design.docx](Head First OO Analysis and Design.docx) file is notes I took down when I read HeadFirstOOAD book. I may want to read notes again at some time later this year because all knowledge points listed are super useful and deserve to refresh my minds once a while.
